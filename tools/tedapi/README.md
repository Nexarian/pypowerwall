# TEDAPI Metrics

The Tesla Powerwall Gateway has an API accessible via the Gateway WiFi used for installation, monitoring and troubleshooting. This API is located at `/tedapi`. 

The API includes configuration and status payloads that can be seen with a simple Protobuf schema definition file [tedapi.proto](tedapi.proto). Accessing this API requires a connection to the endpoint (192.168.91.1) and the Gateway Password (usually found on the QR code inside the Powerwall access panel).

Note: This API will help you read extended data metrics from your system. It is likely capable of changing the configuraiton of the system so please use at your own risk and with caution. 

If you are looking for a way to configure or control your Powerwall, please see the official [FleetAPI](https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/tree/main/tools/fleetapi#tesla-developer---fleetapi-for-powerwall).

## Command Line Tools

Starting with pyPowerwall v0.10.0, you can now access the TEDAPI API via the  command line:

```
# First, install or upgrade if you haven't
pip install -U pypowerwall

# Run the tool
python3 -m pypowerwall.tedapi
```

You will be prompted for the Powerwall Gateway password (usually printed on the QR code on the gateway). It will then query the Powerwall for config and current site data. The payloads will be written to `config.json` and `status.json` in the current directory. Example:

```
Tesla Powerwall Gateway TEDAPI Reader

Enter Powerwall Gateway Password: **********

Connecting to Powerwall Gateway 192.168.91.1

   - Site Name: Energy Gateway
   - Battery Commission Date: 2022-09-25T12:01:00-07:00
   - VIN:  1232100-00-E--TG123456789012
   - Number of Powerwalls: 2

 ```

## Web Proxy Example

The [web.py](web.py) script is a simple prototype web proxy that will access and display the TEDAPI data.

```python
# Run Simple Test Proxy 
python3 web.py <gateway_password>
```

Go to http://localhost:4444
- GET /din - Returns the Powerwall Gateway DIN number
- GET /config - Returns the Powerwall Gateway configuration
- GET /status - Returns the Powerwall Gateway status

## Using the Library

The following example will connect to the gateway and display power data (see also [test_tedapi.py](test_tedapi.py)):

```python
# Import Class
from pypowerwall.tedapi import TEDAPI

gw_pwd = "THEGWPASS"

# Connect to Gateway
gw = TEDAPI(gw_pwd)

# Grab the Config and Live Status
config = gw.get_config()
status = gw.get_status()

# Print
site_info = config.get('site_info', {})
site_name = site_info.get('site_name', 'Unknown')
print(f"My Site: {site_name}")
meterAggregates = status.get('control', {}).get('meterAggregates', [])
for meter in meterAggregates:
    location = meter.get('location', 'Unknown').title()
    realPowerW = int(meter.get('realPowerW', 0))
    print(f"   - {location}: {realPowerW}W")
```

## Additional Research

The [tedapi_orig.py](tetedapi_origdapi.py) script includes the original TEDAPI class and runtime tool that will fetch and save the configuration settings and current live status in `config.json` and `status.json` files:

```bash
# Download 
git clone https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall.git
cd pypowerwall/tools/tedapi

# Install required dependencies
pip install protobuf requests

# Get configuration and status
python tedapi_orig.py
```

## Background

* This requires using the gateway WiFi access point (for PW2/+ systems this is TEG-xxx and for PW3 it is TeslaPW_xxx) and the https://192.168.91.1 endpoint. It seems that this is required for the /tedapi endpoints (LAN or other access results in "User does not have adequate access rights" 403 Error)
* The /tedapi API calls are using binary Protocol Buffers ([protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)) payloads.

The protobuf python bindings were created using this:
```bash
# Build python bindings for protobuf schema - tedapi_pb2.py
protoc --python_out=. tedapi.proto
```

The [decode.py](decode.py) scrip will use the tedapi protobuf schema to decode a specified payload. This is useful for troubleshooting and downloading payloads with curl.

```bash
# Decode payload file
python decode.py <filename>
```

## The TEDAPI APIs

### GET /tedapi/din

This API fetches the Powerwall DIN (device identification number). It uses basic auth that appears to be: Tesla_Energy_Device:GW_PWD where the GW_PWD is the password near the QR code on the Powerwall that you scan with the Tesla Pros app.

```bash
curl -v -k -u "Tesla_Energy_Device:GW_PWD"" https://192.168.91.1/tedapi/din
```

It only returns a simple string that contains the DIN:

```
1232100-00-E--TG123456789012
```

### POST /tedapi/v1

This appears to be the workhorse function. It uses basic auth that appears to be: `Tesla_Energy_Device:GW_PWD` where the GW_PWD is the password near the QR code on the Powerwall that you scan with the Tesla Pros app.

```bash
# First you will need a request.bin - Create example:
python create_request.py

# Request config
curl -v -k -H 'Content-type: application/octet-string' -u "Tesla_Energy_Device:GW_PWD" --data-binary @request.bin https://192.168.91.1/tedapi/v1
```

Payloads are binary Protocol Buffers (protobufs). 

* The [decode.py](decode.py) tool will help decode this using the proto file.
* Or you can use `protoc --decode_raw < v1_request` to decode the raw response.

There appear to be different types of request sent. One is for `config` which gets a payload that contains the configuration of the Powerwall. Another is for `query` that gets current data (e.g. systemStatus, realPowerW, voltages, frequencies, etc.).

#### CONFIG Example

```bash
# First you will need a request.bin - Create example:
python create_request.py

# Request Config Data from Powerwall
curl -v -k -H 'Content-type: application/octet-string' -u "Tesla_Energy_Device:GW_PWD" --data-binary @request.bin https://192.168.91.1/tedapi/v1 > response.bin

# Decode Config Data
python3 decode.py response.bin
```

The request payload set the recipient din:

```
message {
  deliveryChannel: 1
  sender {
    local: 1
  }
  recipient {
    din: "1232100-00-E--TG123456789012"
  }
  config {
    send {
      num: 1
      file: "config.json"
    }
  }
}
tail {
  value: 1
}
```

An example response shows the system config data in the JSON `text` (removed to protect the innocent) and a `code` payload (TBD).

```
message {
  deliveryChannel: 1
  sender {
    din: "1232100-00-E--TG123456789012"
  }
  recipient {
    local: 1
  }
  config {
    recv {
      file {
        name: "config.json"
        text: "{\"vin\":\"1232100-00-E--TG123456789012\",\"meters\": ...Truncated... }"
      }
      code: "\255\177t+5\3530...Truncated..."
    }
  }
}
tail {
  value: 1
}
```

#### QUERY Example

```bash
# Request Status Data from Powerwall
curl -v -k -H 'Content-type: application/octet-string' -u "Tesla_Energy_Device:GW_PWD" --data-binary @query.bin https://192.168.91.1/tedapi/v1 > response.bin

# Decode Config Data
python3 decode.py response.bin
```

To get the status of the Powerwall, send a binary query.bin payload. The structure of the query payload has a `text` query string that seems to be an exhaustive list of labels.  The `code` field is a binary payload.

```
message {
  deliveryChannel: 1
  sender {
    local: 1
  }
  recipient {
    din: "1232100-00-E--TG123456789012"
  }
  payload {
    send {
      num: 2
      payload {
        value: 1
        text: " query DeviceControllerQuery {\n  control {\n    systemStatus {\n        nominalFullPackEnergyWh...Truncated..."
      }
      code: "0\201\210...Truncated..."
      b {
        value: "{}"
      }
    }
  }
}
tail {
  value: 1
}
```

An example response shows the system status data in the JSON `text` field (truncated).

```
message {
  deliveryChannel: 1
  sender {
    din: "1232100-00-E--TG123456789012"
  }
  recipient {
    local: 1
  }
  payload {
    recv {
      value: 1
      text: "{\"control\":{\"alerts\":{\"active\":[\"SystemConnectedToGrid\",\"FWUpdateSucceeded\",\"GridCodesWrite\",\"PodCommissionTime\"]},\"batteryBlocks\":[{\"din\":\"2012170-25-E#TG123456789012\", ...Truncated...\"updateUrgencyCheck\":null}}"
    }
  }
}
tail {
  value: 1
}
```
